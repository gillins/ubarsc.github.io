TuiView 1.2.14 has been released. The main feature of this release
is the removal of the 100million row limit on Raster Attribute Tables
in the Query Windows. This was a limit of Qt but we now implement our
own table view which has no limit. Other improvements have also been made.
See the [CHANGES.txt]( https://github.com/ubarsc/tuiview/blob/master/CHANGES.txt).
