python-fmask 0.5.9 has been released. This fixes a problem with RIOS 1.4.17
and removes the '.py' from the command line scripts to make life easier for
Windows users (and more in line with other packages). The .py command line
scripts will still be available for old code. See the [Release Notes]( https://www.pythonfmask.org/en/latest/releasenotes.html).
