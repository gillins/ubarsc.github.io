A major update of RIOS has been released. Version 2.0 incorporates
strong support for concurrency in reading, computation and writing.
This allows users to make much better use of available hardware, and
to avoid spending large amounts of time waiting for high-latency
storage such as S3. See the 
[Release Notes](https://www.rioshome.org/en/latest/releasenotes.html)
for more information. Version 2.0.0 was released on 2024-05-23, followed
(inevitably) by several minor bug-fix releases shortly thereafter.
